<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<p class="us">VISION THE TECHNICAL SOCIETY OF NIT BHOPAL WAS FOUNDED IN 2008 WITH A GOAL TO INCULCATE IN ENGINEERING STUDENTS THE ZEAL TO INNOVATE AND INVENT. THE IDEA ITSELF WAS SOMETHING BIG AND NOTHING LESS THAN A VISION HENCE THE NAME. WE ORGANISE INFORMATIVE WORKSHOPS, SEMINARS AND ANNUAL EVENTS TO PASS ON KNOWLEDGE RELATED TO VARIOUS ENGINEERING BRANCHES.</p>

<p>VISION PROVIDES A SUITABLE PLATFORM FOR THE STUDENTS TO SHOWCASE THEIR TECHNICAL SKILLS. WE MOTIVATE THEM FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK IN ANY ENGINEERING DOMAIN. WE ALSO GUIDE THEM TO DEVELOP PROJECTS AND EXPLORE THE HOT RESEARCH AREAS OF TODAY(AS MUCH AS ITS POSSIBLE) AND TO SUPPORT THEM FINANCIALLY(SELECTED TEAMS).</p>

<p>WE PROVIDE THEM SUITABLE FACILITIES FOR THEIR RESEARCH WORK. (LIKE BY PROVIDING 24X7 LAB AND EQUIPMENTS). OUR AIM IS TO MOTIVATE STUDENTS IN ACHIEVING THE IN DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE BRANCHES.</p>
